### 🗣️How to use
1. Install an IDE or text editor
   - For this first I really recommend to use **[VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com)**.
2. Install node.js for your machine
   - You can access the link for node.js **[here](https://nodejs.org/en)** to download and install node.js.
3. Install the dependencies
   - You have to install the dependencies if you want to execute all the project, and you can do it opening the terminal in your machine and execute the following command in the directory that the project aldready is:
     
     ```
     npm install
     ```
4. Execute the project
   - Now the files and dependencies was downloaded and installed. Since you made all of the steps and has the node, npm and express in your machine, you can execute the project with a following command:
  
     ```
     npm start
     ``` 
   - The command above will show at the first the two command lines that were executed by the json file, and the third that is the link to acces the application, in your terminal will show a something like this:

      ```
      >cod@1.0.0 start //The first line
      >node indes.js //The second line

      http://localhost:3000 //The third line
  
      ```

   - Then you can press ctrl + click in the link to open in your web browser or copy the link and paste in the web browser then press enter.
